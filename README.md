# Portable Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Measurement Device

A smart, portable, non-contact tonometer designed for **home-based monitoring** of Intraocular Pressure (IOP) and Central Corneal Thickness (CCT). Built to aid early detection and management of **glaucoma** and other eye conditions such as **corneal edema** and **uveitis**, this device combines **air-puff technology**, **infrared sensing**, and **AI-powered analytics** in a compact, affordable form.

 🔬 Project Overview

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Regular monitoring of IOP is essential for early detection and treatment. Traditional tonometers are bulky, expensive, and require professional operation. This project aims to solve that by offering:

- **Non-contact air-puff based measurement**
- **Integrated CCT correction for accuracy**
- **Bluetooth connectivity and app support**
- **AI & ML for trend analysis and predictions**
- **User-friendly, hygienic, and compact design**

 📦 Features

- ✅ **IOP & CCT Measurement** with IR reflection and air-puff technology
- ✅ **CCT-based Correction** for improved IOP accuracy
- ✅ **Bluetooth Sync** with mobile app (Clear Sight)
- ✅ **Auto Nozzle Cleaning** for hygiene and consistency
- ✅ **OLED Display** for instant results
- ✅ **AI/ML Integration** for predictive health monitoring
- ✅ **Telemedicine Ready** for remote doctor consultations
- ✅ **Rechargeable Li-ion Battery** with long backup
